Changes in protocol:

1) At handshake stage you send {"me": token} instead of {"me": name}. 
You may receive {"you": name} or {"kicked": reason} in response.
In the first case you'll be send registered bot name.
The second may appear if server accepts no more players or if you bot has too many simultaneous connections.
2) If you timed out, you get {"timeout": 0} - without indicating time limit. Time limits are stated in protocols.
3) During the game if you are kicked due to invalid request, you'll be sent message: {"kicked": reason}.


Replay format:

1) Handshakes are not recorded in replay. Instead there is a single key "participants" in the beginning:
        {"participants": [{"punter": number, "name": name }, ... ]}
2) Setup request is only recorded once (for punter 0), to provide map and settings
3) No gameplay requests from server are recorded
4) Gameplay responses from players are saved in the order they are send, every erroneous move is changed to pass. They have several additional fields:
        * moveno - move number, to additionally assert their order;
        * timespan - answering time (measured at server). Not recorded for setup response and erroneous moves;
        * error - for forced passes, states the error that occured;
        * original - if move was valid, but illegal at given map (river already claimed or non-existent, extension absent), the originally declared move is recorded here.
5) Score record hasn't last moves, and is formatted: {"scores": [score_record]}, where:
        score_record is {"punter": punter, "name": name, "score": score, "futures": [...]}
